- why wse deserve marks:
Code on Github (15 marks)

◦ ﻿﻿Data modeling: Do the data structures reflect the problem domain? (2 mark) 

◦ ﻿﻿Immutable data and idempotent methods: Is the type system used to prevent incorrect code from being written? (2 mark)

◦ ﻿﻿Functional separation: Is the problem broken down into meaning parts? (3 mark)

◦ ﻿﻿Loose coupling: Can parts be changed in isolation of each other? (2 mark)

◦ ﻿﻿Extensibility: How easy would it be to add, remove, or change functionality? Could a new mechanic or new content be added by changing data instead of changing code? (2 mark)
Within the code, the use of adding categories and adjusting the tasks is simple and does not change the code at all. 

◦ ﻿﻿Error handling: Are errors detected at appropriate places? Is the user prevented from entering invalid input and guided toward valid input? (2 mark)
Warning messages are displayed in order to prevent the user from entering invalid inputs and errors and guides them in putting valid inputs. 
The Button logic validates whether the task names and task Description are empty before allowing task creation. The user is prevented from continuing if inputs are invalid, there will be a warning that displays an error message to guide users. The delete button will show a warning to confirm if user really wants to delete. This will prevent the user from making an incorrect decision. 

◦ ﻿﻿Demonstration of collaborative work on Github. (2 mark)
Each member has contributed to their part of the project.
